NOTES
===
sync_battlelog takes the playersID, the Subject type, and all_matches.
    - all_matches = True: grab all 10 pages regardless of database
    - (unimplemented) all_matches = False: only grab the pages that do not have matches from today

TODO
===
 - ALL MATCHES gets as many pages as it can
        - Default behavior is get as many pages for matches that happened TODAY.
        - There is a limit of 100 matches recorded a day, may not be possible to track all matches.
            - Mark data as possibly incomplete?

- every url pulled, log it and log where I put the data

Is the scraper way too complicated? 
    - Looking up filename/paths shouldn't be this hard
